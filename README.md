# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Competition
[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) on Kaggle tests skills in machine learning and data analysis! The goal of the competition is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on various features provided in the dataset.

Check out my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/tonyhollaar/kaggle-competitions/blob/main/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster.ipynb) for a detailed walkthrough of my approach. I've documented the steps I took, the preprocessing techniques applied, the machine learning models used, and the evaluation of results. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback!
## Key Methodologies

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyze ticket class, gender, age, and more.
- Visualize with histograms, box plots, and more.
- Handle missing data judiciously.
- Split data for insightful analysis.

🔧 **Precision-Crafted Feature Engineering:**
- Segment 'Age' into meaningful groups.
- Extract insights from 'Title' using regular expressions.
- Categorize 'Fare' through quantiles.

📊 **Insightful Data Visualization:**
- Visualize survival correlations.
- Use stacked bar charts for category insights.

🛠️ **Strategic Feature Augmentation:**
- Introduce 'Age_missing' and 'Fare_0' attributes.
- Enhance predictive power with engineered features.

🌌 **Venturing into Deep Learning:**
- Explore deep learning techniques.
- Architect Sequential model with Dense and Dropout layers.
- Decode accuracy and loss trends through epochs.
